But how can we apply higher-order network analytics to such such data in practice?\n",

    "In the first two sessions of our tutorial we introduce [``pathpy``](http://www.pathpy.net), an OpenSource `python` package that provides higher-order data analytics and representation learning techniques. It contains data structures, algorithms, data import/export methods, and visualisation techniques for various types of time series data on complex networks.\n",
