We then draw edges between higher-order nodes whenever there is a possible path of length $k$ in the underlying network. The result is a $k$-dimensional De Bruijn graph model for paths.

Importantly, this deviation from our expectation changes the causal topology of the system, i.e. who can influence whom. In a network model we implicitly assume that paths are transitive, i.e. since $a$ is connected to $c$ and $c$ is connected to $d$ we assume that there is a path by which $a$ can influence $d$ via node $c$. The second-order model of our toy example reveals that this transitivity assumption is misleading, highlighting higher-order dependencies in our data that result in the fact that neither $a$ can influence $d$ nor $b$ can influence $e$.\n",
