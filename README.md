# Beyond Graph Mining: Higher-Order Data Analytics for Temporal Network Data

In this repository, wou will find all material needed to complete the KDD'18 hands-on tutorial on Higher-Order Data Analytics for Temporal Network Data.  

A summary of the tutorial can be found in the [detailed proposal](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325168357_Beyond_Graph_Mining_Higher-Order_Data_Analytics_for_Temporal_Network_Data).

A detailed [tutorial schedule](https://IngoScholtes.github.io/kdd2018-tutorial/) as well as [step-by-step setup instructions](https://IngoScholtes.github.io/kdd2018-tutorial/setup) can be found on the [tutorial website](https://IngoScholtes.github.io/kdd2018-tutorial/).

While you can manually download all necessary files, we strongly recommend to clone this repository to obtain a local, sychronised copy of all material via `git`. Assuming you have a local `git` installation, you can do this as follows:  

`git clone https://github.com/IngoScholtes/kdd2018-tutorial`

If you don't have `git` installed already, here you can find information on [how to set up git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).

Prior to the hands-on tutorial, you will get access to skeleton `python` files, that we will complete together throughout the tutorial sessions. At specific *synchronisation points, we will push a commit of the current solution to this `gitHub` repository. You can thus simply execute the terminal command

`git pull`

in the directory of your local copy to receive a *sample solution* that is growing as the tutorial advances.
